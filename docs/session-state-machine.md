# Session State Machine

## Overview

A session tracks a group of badge hunters meeting to complete badges together.
Every session has a **global status** and each member has a **per-user review
state** stored in `SessionUserAcknowledgement`.

---

## Global Session Status (`Session.status`)

| Status                  | Meaning                                                         |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `active`                | Session is live. Members can select/complete badges.            |
| `completed_pending_ack` | Someone started the review. Members confirm their completions.  |
| `closed`                | All members completed their review. Session is archived.        |

## Per-User Review State (`SessionUserAcknowledgement`)

| `needsReview` | `acknowledgedAt` | Meaning                                          |
|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `true`        | `null`            | User has not completed their review yet.          |
| `false`       | `<timestamp>`     | User has completed their review.                  |

## Review Flow

The review process has two phases: entering review mode (client-side) and
completing the session (server-side).

1. **Enter Review Mode** (client-side only) — Any member clicks "Review." This
   is purely a UI state change (`isReviewing = true`). No server state changes.
   The session is still `active`. The member sees completion checkboxes and a
   "Complete Session" button. They can also "Cancel Review" to go back.

2. **Complete Session** (`completeMyReview`) — The member clicks "Complete Session"
   after checking off their badge completions. This:
   - If session is still `active`, transitions to `completed_pending_ack`.
   - Marks that user's ack as done.
   - Notifies other members who still need to review (skips already-done members).
   - When all members have completed, the session auto-closes.

---

## State Transitions

### 1. Session Creation → `active`

A session is created with status `active`. All members get an ack row with
`needsReview: true, acknowledgedAt: null`.

### 2. Enter Review Mode (client-side only)

**Trigger:** Any member clicks "Review".

**What happens:**
- No server changes. Client-side `isReviewing` state toggles on.
- UI shows review prompt, completion checkboxes, and "Complete Session" button.
- Member can click "Cancel Review" to go back to active mode.

### 3. Complete Session (per-user)

**Trigger:** A member clicks "Complete Session".

**What happens:**
- If session is still `active`, transitions to `completed_pending_ack`
  (`Session.completedAt` and `Session.completedByUserId` set).
- That user's ack is updated (`needsReview: false, acknowledgedAt: now()`).
- That user's review notification is deleted.
- Other members who still need review and don't already have a notification get one.

### 4. All Members Completed → `completed_pending_ack` to `closed`

**Trigger:** The last member completes their review (automatic check after step 3).

**What happens:**
- After updating the ack, the system checks if any `needsReview: true` remain.
- If none remain → session status becomes `closed`.
- Any remaining review notifications are cleaned up.

### 5. Dismiss Review (client-side only)

**Trigger:** A member clicks "Cancel Review" while in server-pushed review mode
(i.e., someone else completed and the session is `completed_pending_ack`).

**Restriction:** Only available when user has **NOT** completed their own review
and the date has NOT passed.

**What happens:**
- No server changes. Client-side `dismissedReview` state toggles on.
- The review UI is hidden — the session appears in its pre-review state.
- The "Review" button reappears so the user can re-enter review mode later.
- Navigating away and returning will show the review mode again (dismiss is
  not persisted).

### 6. Re-open (personal undo)

**Trigger:** A member clicks "Re-open" on a session where they are personally
done. Available for both `completed_pending_ack` (user already completed) and
`closed` sessions.

**Restriction:** Only allowed when the session date has **NOT** passed
(`Date.now() <= expiresAt`). Past-date sessions show "Edit" instead.

**What happens:**
- Only the caller's ack is reset to `needsReview: true, acknowledgedAt: null`.
- The caller's review notification is deleted.
- If session was `closed`, it transitions to `completed_pending_ack` (since at
  least the caller now needs review).
- Other users are NOT affected — their ack state and notifications are untouched.
- **Edge case:** If ALL users have now uncompleted (all `needsReview: true`), the
  session reverts to `active`, and `completedAt`/`completedByUserId` are cleared.
  All remaining review notifications are cleaned up.

### 7. Edit Mode (client-side only, anyone)

**Trigger:** The "Edit" button on past-date sessions. Available to anyone
(members and non-members).

**What happens:**
- Client-side only — no server state changes.
- Shows badge selection tab and completion checkboxes.
- Exiting edit mode returns to the closed/read-only view.
- Any badge completion changes during edit ARE persisted server-side.

---

## Date Logic

The session's `expiresAt` is set to **6:00 AM the day after the session date**
(local time). This is the cutoff for "past date."

### Past-Date Active Sessions (implicit review mode)

When a session is still `active` but the date has passed (`Date.now() > expiresAt`):
- **For members:** The UI treats it as **effectively in review**, even though the
  global status is still `active`.
  - Members see the review prompt: "The session date has passed. Review your badge
    completions and complete your session."
  - The "Complete Session" button is available.
  - The "Undo My Review" button is **NOT** available (date has passed).
  - Once anyone completes, the `active` → `completed_pending_ack` transition
    fires and notifications go out to others who still need review.
- **For non-members:** The UI shows "Closed" — they don't see review workflow details.

### Future Sessions

A session is "future" when `sessionDateLA > today` and status is `active`.
- The "Review" button is hidden.
- Members can select badges but cannot start the review.

### Cancel Restrictions

| Condition                 | Can re-open? |
|---------------------------|--------------|
| Date NOT passed           | Yes          |
| Date passed               | No (Edit)    |

## Badge Selection During Review vs Edit

| Phase              | Badge selection tab visible? | Rationale                                    |
|--------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Active             | Yes                          | Planning phase — pick your badges            |
| Review (pending)   | No                           | Confirmation phase — just check completions  |
| Edit (client-side) | Yes                          | Correction mode — add forgotten badges       |
| Future             | Yes                          | Pre-planning allowed                         |

## Inter-User Activity Summary

| Action                        | Effect on the acting user     | Effect on other users                                   |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Review (click button)         | Client-side only              | None                                                    |
| Cancel Review                 | Client-side only (dismiss)    | None                                                    |
| Complete Session              | Ack → done, notification rm   | Session → `completed_pending_ack` (if active), others who still need review are notified (unless last → session closes) |
| Re-open                       | Ack → reset                   | `closed` → `completed_pending_ack`, `completed_pending_ack` unchanged. Other acks untouched. (If all uncomplete → `active`.) |
| Leave Session                 | Removed from session          | Ack deleted, notifications deleted for that user        |
| Added to Session              | Ack created (`needsReview`)   | `session_added` notification sent to added user         |

## Notification Types

| Type             | Created when                                       | Deleted when                                                          |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `session_added`  | User is added to a session (not self-join)         | User is removed from session                                          |
| `session_review` | Someone completes their session (sent to others who still need review) | User completes own review, session reverts to `active`, session closes |

---

## Non-Member vs Member Status Display

Non-members see a simplified view. The internal review workflow (pending review,
ack states) is irrelevant to them — they just need to know if the session is
still happening or done.

| Viewer     | Status shown                                                              |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Non-member | "Active" (if not `closed` and not past-date) or "Closed" (otherwise)     |
| Member     | Full granularity: Active, Future, Reviewing, Closed                       |

Non-members can still enter **Edit mode** on past-date sessions to help correct
badge completions.
